### Features

The website is comprised of four pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, books page & contact us page). The fourth page is a thank you page which is shown once a user submits the form on the contact us page.

All Pages on the website have:

- A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an image of book clubs logo together with the text Bully Book Club. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, books, and contact us). To allow a good user experience of the site, the Bully Book Club text is hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram and goodreads. There is also an envelope icon which takes the user to the contact us page. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.
