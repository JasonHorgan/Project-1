## Design

### Color Scheme 

!(assets/css/images/phil_color_scheme.jpeg)

The Website uses a Color Palette of reds and blues which are colors that Phil often wore and there are photos of him wearing this colors on the site. There are also some pastel colors to make the text look more visually pleasing to the reader.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- Merriweather is used for headings on the site. It is a serif font.

- Raleway is used for the body text on the site. It is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery 

Images were used with the permission of the owners and taken from royalty free sites. 

### Wireframe 

The Wireframe was created using Balsamiq and can be viewed here (insert balsamic link here)

### Features

The website is comprised of four pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, books page & contact us page). The fourth page is a thank you page which is shown once a user submits the form on the contact us page.

All Pages on the website have:

- A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. The Nav bar contains links to the home page, gallery, video section and the submit section. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This is typically seen on mobile sites and makes for a better user experience. 

A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram, Facebook, X and Youtube. I used icons to identify the websites and when the user clicks on them, they are taken to a new tab so they do not lose my site. 

### Home Page.

The home page is the main page of the site at the moment. This is where the user will find a lot of information and read other user stories about who Phil Lynott was, as well as other interesting facts about him. There are also a number of photographs with alt text included for accesibility.

### Gallery 

The gallery features a number of photographs of Phil Lynott over the course of his life.

### Videos

The video section contains music videos of Phil Lynotts most popular songs, as well as interviews about him to give the user more context of who he was as a person. 

### Submit

The submit section of the website contains a form where users can submit stories detailing interactions regular people had with Phil over the course of his life so these stories are not lost over time.
