          Philip Parris Lynott (20 August 1949 – 4 January 1986) was an Irish
          musician, songwriter, and poet. He was the co-founder, lead vocalist,
          bassist, and primary songwriter for the hard rock band Thin Lizzy. He
          was known for his distinctive pick-based style on the bass and for his
          imaginative lyrical contributions, including working class tales and
          numerous characters drawn from personal influences and Celtic culture.
          <br/>
          Lynott was born in the West Midlands of England but grew up in Dublin
          with his grandparents. He remained close to his mother, Philomena,
          throughout his life. He fronted several bands as a lead vocalist,
          including Skid Row alongside Gary Moore, before learning the bass
          guitar and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. After initial success with
          "Whiskey in the Jar", the band had several hits in the mid-1970s, such
          as "The Boys Are Back in Town", "Jailbreak" and "Waiting for an
          Alibi", and became a popular live attraction combining Lynott's vocal
          and songwriting skills with dual lead guitars.
          <br/>
          Towards the end of the 1970s, Lynott embarked upon a solo career and
          published two books of poetry. After Thin Lizzy disbanded, he
          assembled and fronted the band Grand Slam. In the 1980s, Lynott
          increasingly suffered drug-related problems, particularly an addiction
          to heroin. In 1985, he had a final chart success with Moore, "Out in
          the Fields", before his death in 1986. He remains a popular figure in
          the rock world, and in 2005, a statue in his memory was erected in
          Dublin.

        <p>
          Phil Lynott was born in Hallam Hospital in West Bromwich, England
          His mother, Philomena Lynott, was born in Dublin and his father,
          Cecil Parris, was from Georgetown, British Guiana. Philomena met
          Parris, who had moved to England to seek work, in Birmingham in 1948
          and they were in a relationship for a few months, until Parris was
          transferred to London. Shortly afterwards, Philomena found she was
          pregnant and, after Lynott was born, she moved with her baby to a home
          for unmarried mothers in Selly Park, where he was baptised on 4
          September. Philomena subsequently moved to Manchester but stayed in
          touch with Parris who helped pay towards his son's support. She
          subsequently had two more children who were placed for adoption.
          <br/>
          Lynott believed he was different from his peers at school, but didn't
          suffer any major racist attacks. Lynott first attended school in
          Moss Side, Manchester. In 1957, due to accounts of racism and Lynott
          being mixed race, his mother sent him to live with his grandparents,
          Frank and Sarah Lynott, in Crumlin, Dublin. The move was important as
          the presence of Frank gave him a father figure for the first time in
          his life. His mother stayed in Manchester and remained close to her
          son. She later took over the management of the Clifton Grange Hotel in
          Whalley Range with her partner, Dennis Keeley. The hotel,
          nicknamed "The Biz", became popular with showbusiness entertainers,
          and was later referred to in a song on Thin Lizzy's debut album.
          Lynott had a happy childhood growing up in Dublin and was a popular
          character at school.

          <p>
            During the recording of the band's second album, Shades of a Blue
            Orphanage (1972), Lynott very nearly left Thin Lizzy to form a new
            band with Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice, called Baby
            Face. "Ritchie turned up in the studio one day to jam," recalled
            Downey. "I was asked to play drums to Phil and Ritchie jamming… Me
            and Eric looked at each other like, 'Well, that's the end of the
            band then.' It lasted a week, then Phil came back as if nothing had
            happened. He wanted to be the leader of his own band, not the singer
            in someone else's." Due to being in dire financial straits Lizzy
            did, however, soon record an album of Deep Purple covers under the
            name Funky Junction. Lynott did not sing on the album as he felt his
            voice was not in the same style as Ian Gillan. Towards the end
            of 1972, Thin Lizzy got their first major break in the UK by
            supporting Slade, then nearing the height of their commercial
            success. Inspired by Noddy Holder's top hat with mirrors, Lynott
            decided to attach a mirror to his bass, which he carried over to
            subsequent tours. On the opening night of the tour, an altercation
            broke out between Lynott and Slade's manager Chas Chandler, who
            chastised Lynott's lack of stage presence and interaction with the
            audience and threatened to throw Lizzy off the tour unless things
            improved immediately. Lynott subsequently developed the onstage
            rapport and stage presence that would become familiar over the
            remainder of the decade.

          <p>
            Lynott was introduced to music through his uncle Timothy's record
            collection, and became influenced by Motown and The Mamas & the
            Papas. He joined his first band, the Black Eagles in 1965 as a lead
            singer, playing popular covers in local clubs around Dublin.
            He attended the Christian Brothers School in Crumlin, where he
            became friends with Brian Downey, who was later persuaded to join
            the band from the Liffey Beats. The group fell apart due to the
            lack of interest of manager Joe Smith, particularly after the
            departure of his two sons, guitarists Danny and Frankie.
            <br/>
            Lynott then left the family home and moved into a flat in Clontarf,
            where he briefly joined the group Kama Sutra. It was in this band
            that he learned his frontman skills, and worked out how to interact
            with an audience. In early 1968, he teamed up with bassist
            Brendan 'Brush' Shiels to form Skid Row. Downey was not interested
            in Shiels' request to be the drummer, so the job went to Noel
            Bridgeman. The band signed a deal with Ted Carroll, who would
            later go on to manage Thin Lizzy, and played a variety of covers
            including "Eight Miles High", "Hey Jude" and several numbers by Jimi
            Hendrix. Because Lynott did not play an instrument at this point
            in his career, he instead manipulated his voice through an echo box
            during instrumental sections. He took to smearing boot polish under
            his eyes on stage to draw attention to himself, which he would
            continue to do throughout Lizzy's career later on, and regularly
            performed a mock fight with Shiels onstage to attract the crowd.
