          Philip Parris Lynott (20 August 1949 â€“ 4 January 1986) was an Irish
          musician, songwriter, and poet. He was the co-founder, lead vocalist,
          bassist, and primary songwriter for the hard rock band Thin Lizzy. He
          was known for his distinctive pick-based style on the bass and for his
          imaginative lyrical contributions, including working class tales and
          numerous characters drawn from personal influences and Celtic culture.

          class="phil"
        />

        <p>
          Lynott was born in the West Midlands of England but grew up in Dublin
          with his grandparents. He remained close to his mother, Philomena,
          throughout his life. He fronted several bands as a lead vocalist,
          including Skid Row alongside Gary Moore, before learning the bass
          guitar and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. After initial success with
          "Whiskey in the Jar", the band had several hits in the mid-1970s, such
          as "The Boys Are Back in Town", "Jailbreak" and "Waiting for an
          Alibi", and became a popular live attraction combining Lynott's vocal
          and songwriting skills with dual lead guitars. Towards the end of the
          1970s, Lynott embarked upon a solo career and published two books of
          poetry. After Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band
          Grand Slam.

        />

        <p>
          After a successful multi-band tour in support of Status Quo, the band
          recorded the album Jailbreak, which proved to be their breakthrough
          record. Released on 26 March 1976, it featured the worldwide hit "The
          Boys Are Back in Town" which reached No. 8 in the UK, and No. 12 in
          the US, their first charting record in that country. The album also
          charted well on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching No. 10 in the UK
          and No. 18 in the US, and the follow-up single, "Jailbreak", also
          performed well. The twin guitar sound had been fully developed by this
          time and was in evidence throughout the album, particularly on the hit
          single, and other tracks such as "Emerald", "Warriors" and "Cowboy
          Song". The album is considered to have financially secured the band,
          not only enabling them to survive and continue, but also be able to
          feel the freedom needed to be able to experiment with higher concept
          thought and Lynott's more lyrically challenging pieces that the group
          went on to pen. Thin Lizzy toured the US in support of various bands
          such as Aerosmith, Rush and REO Speedwagon, and they planned to tour
          there again in June 1976, this time with Rainbow. However, Lynott fell
          ill with hepatitis and the tour was cancelled, which set them back a
          few months.

        <p>
          In 1980, though Thin Lizzy were still enjoying considerable success,
          Lynott launched a solo career with the album, Solo in Soho: this was a
          Top 30 UK album and yielded two hit singles that year, "Dear Miss
          Lonelyhearts" and "King's Call". The latter was a tribute to Elvis
          Presley, and featured Mark Knopfler on guitar.[48] His second solo
          venture, The Philip Lynott Album (1982) was a chart flop, despite the
          presence of the single "Old Town". The song "Yellow Pearl" (1982), was
          a No. 14 hit in the UK and became the theme tune to Top of the
          Pops.[49]
